# H-M-Analysis

Link to the website: https://www2.hm.com/en_us/women/products/view-all.html

I have just scraped onethird of the available data on this page(i.e. I scraped 1079 prodcuts out of total around 3000 availbe on the website)
I have scraped the offical website of H&M to derive insights on Women's clothing, category: All for the following fields:
1. Item name
2. Discounted Price (In my entire analysis I have considered this field as the selling price)
3. Original Price

This is an exploratory data analysis to derive primary conclusions based on the data.
The PowerBI visualization is a sample of how i would visualize this data.
I have also used Pytho (Jupyter Notebook) to conduct this exploratory Data Analysis
